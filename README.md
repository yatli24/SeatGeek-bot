# SeatGeek Discord Bot
A public discord application that enables multiple users to track the prices of multiple events from SeatGeek, and uses scikit.learn to analyze pricing trends and user preferences to generate a predictive model for future pricing. 
This model is then taken to reccomend the user the best dates for the most cost effective ticket prices of selected artists' future events.

The discord bot is also capable of using image recognition to generate observations about user profile pictures.

Uses the SeatGeek API for event data and Google Cloud MySQL to store user event data.

Original SeatGeek API login info, as well as database credentials have been omitted from the public code.
