# SeatGeek Discord Bot
# A public discord application that enables multiple users to track the prices of multiple events from SeatGeek, and uses scikit.learn to analyze pricing trends and user preferences to generate a predictive model for future pricing. 
# Uses the SeatGeek API for price data and Google Cloud MySQL to store user event data.
# Original SeatGeek API login info, as well as database credentials have been omitted from the public code.
# Invite the Seater bot to your Discord server!
